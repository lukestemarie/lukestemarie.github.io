# IR Remote Door Lock System

## Overview
Designed and built an infrared (IR) remote-controlled door locking system
that enables secure, contactless actuation of a mechanical lock using
embedded control logic and electromechanical actuation.

## System Architecture
Brief description of how the system is structured.
(You can later add a block diagram image here.)

## Hardware
- Microcontroller (model)
- IR receiver module
- Motor or solenoid
- Power supply
- Locking mechanism

## Software / Control Logic
- IR signal decoding
- Command validation
- Lock/unlock state machine
- Safety or timeout logic

## Results & Testing
- Response time
- Reliability under repeated use
- Any failure modes observed

## What I Did
Be explicit:
- Designed circuit
- Wrote firmware
- Integrated hardware
- Tested system

## Lessons Learned
(Optional but strong)
What you’d improve or what you learned technically.
